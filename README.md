# Scheduling

## Project Overview
For this project, I implemented different scheduling processes, including Round Robin and First Come First Serve using C++ on Ubuntu VirtualBox. I had to find the wait time, the turn-around time and burst time.


## How I complete the completed the project? 
1. The first step was to try to see how each "time" was calculated under each scheduling processes so that I can apply them in my code. I used these links to implement the logic to this program:[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uGblP-ag3o) [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/)
